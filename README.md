## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

1. **index.html**: The main landing page for the Dune: Imperium game. It will display the engaging animations, high-quality images of game components, and concise, captivating text.
2. **_includes/header.html**: This HTML partial will contain the header content for the application, including a navigation bar with links to different pages or sections of the landing page.
3. **_includes/footer.html**: This HTML partial will contain the footer content for the application, including copyright information or social media links.
4. **_includes/navigation.html**: This HTML partial will contain the navigation elements for the application, including a menu or list of links. It can be used within the _includes/header.html partial.
5. **_includes/animations.html**: This HTML partial will contain the code for creating the engaging animations to enhance the user experience of the landing page.

### Routes

1. **/:** The main route that will render the index.html template. This root URL will act as the landing page for the Dune: Imperium game.
2. **/_includes/header**: This route will render the _includes/header.html partial, which can be included in other templates to display the header section of the landing page.
3. **/_includes/footer**: This route will render the _includes/footer.html partial, which can be included in other templates to display the footer section of the landing page.
4. **/_includes/navigation**: This route will render the _includes/navigation.html partial, which can be included in the _includes/header.html partial to display the navigation elements.
5. **/_includes/animations**: This route will render the _includes/animations.html partial, which can be included in the index.html template to display the engaging animations on the landing page.

### Additional Considerations

- Use Bootstrap as the frontend framework to ensure a responsive and visually appealing landing page.
- Implement CSS animations using CSS classes or JavaScript to create smooth and non-distracting animations.
- Use a color scheme inspired by the Dune universe, featuring deep blues, rich oranges, and sandy neutrals.
- Incorporate high-quality images of the game components, artwork, and thematic elements to showcase the game's features and appeal to potential players.
